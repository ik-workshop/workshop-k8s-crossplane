      The Example provider adds support for example resources to Crossplane.
    provider: example
# Required.
spec:
  # Required. Currently supports only the image field, but may be extended with
  # other fields (e.g. health probes, env vars) in future.
  controller:
    # Required. Specifies an OCI image that must run the Crossplane provider
    # when invoked. Note that this is distinct from the package OCI image.
    image: example/provider-example:v0.1.0
  # Optional. Specifies a Crossplane version that the package is compatible with.
  crossplane: v0.13.0
  # Optional. Used by Crossplane to ensure any dependencies of a provider are
  # installed and running before the provider is installed. Unlikely to be used
  # in practice.
  dependsOn:
    # Required. Specifies an OCI image containing a package dependency. This key
    # may be either 'provider' or 'configuration'. This is sugar; in either case
    # the package manager determines whether the depencency is really a Provider
    # or a Configuration by unpacking it and inspecting its kind.
  - provider: example/provider-uncommon
    # Required. Will be extended to support version ranges in future, but
    # currently treated as a specific version tag.
    version: v0.1.0
  # Optional. Permissions that should be added to the ServiceAccount assigned to
  # the provider controller. The controller will automatically have permissions
  # on any CRDs it installs, but may specify additional permissions as well. The
  # package manager may or may not allow the additional permissions, depending
  # on how it is configured.
